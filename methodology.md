## 1.  DevOps Culture
Shifting to DevOps is not just about tools and pipelines—it's a fundamental cultural transformation.
While having the right processes and tools is important, real success comes when individuals across development, operations, and security adopt a DevOps mindset—one that values trust, rapid feedback, and continuous improvement.

## Seven Core Principles of DevOps Culture

Create a highly collaborative environment – Break down silos between teams to encourage open communication and joint problem-solving.

Automate when possible – Use automation to eliminate repetitive tasks and reduce human error, freeing up teams for high-value work.

Focus on customer needs – Keep end-user satisfaction at the center of every decision.

Develop small and release often – Ship in small, manageable increments to reduce risk and get faster feedback.

Include security at every phase – Integrate security practices from the very beginning (DevSecOps), not as an afterthought.

Continuously experiment and learn – Encourage innovation by creating safe spaces to try, fail, and grow.

Continuously improve – Regularly reflect on what's working and what isn't, and make changes accordingly.

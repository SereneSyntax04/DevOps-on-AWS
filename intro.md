#  🔧⚙️💻 What is DevOps ? 

1.  **DevOps** is short for Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). 
**Dev** are the people and processes that create software. 
**Ops** are the teams and processes that deliver and monitor the software.

2.  DevOps improves delivery efficiency and predictability of the application and services.
   
3. Why DevOps?
  - Speeds up product delivery
  - Improves quality
  - Enhances collaboration between Development and Operations teams

## 🔧 Develpoer's focus 

1. Change code quickly
2. Release often
3. Success = delivery speed

## 💻 Operation's focus 
1. Maintain application stability
2. Ensure reliability, especially during high traffic
3. Frequent releases = risk of instability

## 🔧 DevOps Solution --
1. Breaks Down Silos: 
   Dev team finishes code → hands it to Ops → Ops faces deployment issues → blames Dev → QA finds bugs late → everyone frustrated.
   DevOps breaks these walls and gets everyone working together, often from the start of the project.

2. Encourages Collaboration + Automation: 
   Teams share responsibility (Collaboration). 
   Builds, tests, deployments – all automated.Enables Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

3. Balances Speed + Stability:
   DevOps isn’t just about going fast—it’s about going fast without breaking things.
   - Developers can release frequently.
   - Ops ensures the app stays stable, even under load.
   - Automated testing, monitoring, and rollback plans help catch issues early and fix them quickly.

# 🚫 Problems with Traditional Development Practices
Traditional software development is slow and causes delays due to rigid methods, manual work, and disconnected teams. It makes delivering fast, high-quality apps difficult.

## Waterfall Development
- Slow and rigid: Not flexible, hard to make changes once started.
- Fixed requirements: Everything is planned at the beginning and rarely changes.
- Separate phases: Work is done step-by-step (design → build → test), not together.
- Specialized teams: Each phase handled by different experts, causing slow handovers.
- Tool and info mismatch: Teams often switch tools and need to clear up confusion during handoffs.
- Late testing & security: These come after development, so fixing issues becomes costly and time-consuming.

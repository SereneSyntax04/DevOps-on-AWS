# AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) 
It is a tool that lets you interact with AWS services directly from your terminal or command prompt using simple commands — instead of clicking around in the AWS Management Console.

## Basics:

1. You install it on your PC.
2. You log in with your AWS credentials.
3. You can create, manage, and delete AWS resources (like S3 buckets, EC2 instances) using commands.

> Example:
> aws s3 ls → lists all your S3 buckets.

* It's useful for automation, scripting, and working faster with AWS.

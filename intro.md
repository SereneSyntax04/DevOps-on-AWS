3. Frequent releases = risk of instability

## ðŸ”§ DevOps Solution --
1. Breaks Down Silos: 
   Dev team finishes code â†’ hands it to Ops â†’ Ops faces deployment issues â†’ blames Dev â†’ QA finds bugs late â†’ everyone frustrated.
   DevOps breaks these walls and gets everyone working together, often from the start of the project.

2. Encourages Collaboration + Automation: 
   Teams share responsibility (Collaboration). 
   Builds, tests, deployments â€“ all automated.Enables Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

3. Balances Speed + Stability:
   DevOps isnâ€™t just about going fastâ€”itâ€™s about going fast without breaking things.
   - Developers can release frequently.
   - Ops ensures the app stays stable, even under load.
   - Automated testing, monitoring, and rollback plans help catch issues early and fix them quickly.
